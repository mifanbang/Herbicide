Removing flowers and rabbits in the game Mirror

## Disclaimers

In addition to the lack of warranty as this software is distributed, the use of this software may lead to violation of an agreement that you have agreed with Valve Corporation and/or any other party regarding the game [*Mirror*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/644560/Mirror/). Please be aware of that you are totally at your own risk.

## Introduction

The gameplay of Mirror is very obscene by its nature. Thus censorship for insignificant things, e.g., the nipples, is clearly nonsense. The artist(s) actually had done a great job painting those amazing illustrations and you don't want to miss any detail in the game.

## How to Use

Just run the program and stay calm.

## Known Issues

Since the project cannot contain any copyrighted material from the game, it can only unsensor if the censorship is done by overlapping multiple game assets. Certain contents of the game, e.g., the ending scenes, may not be uncensored because the censorship is built into the illustration as integral part of a single asset.

## Building the Code

The solution file and project files in this repository are maintained with Visual Studio 2017 (get one for free at https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Support of various features in C++17 and the function attribute __declspec(naked) are required if you are building with other compilers. Please also note that Herbicide uses DLL injection as its core mechanism and Mirror is still built as 32-bit application, so there's no need to build a 64-bit version of the project.

## Notes on Anti-Virus Software

Some ill-developed anti-virus software may report Herbicide as malware. Please do not panic. You can either add Herbicide into the exception list of your AV (if you trust this software) or submit a report in the [Issues page](https://github.com/mifanbang/Herbicide/issues).
